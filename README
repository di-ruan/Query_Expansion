c) How to run:
    python main.py <bing account key> <precision> <query>

    where:
        * bing account key: the Bing Account Key used for searching
        * precision: a real number between 0 and 1
        * query: a list of words in single quotes

d) Internal design:
    1. The program is composed of 2 parts
    2. The query expansion algorithm is written in QueryExpansion.py

e) Details of query modification:
1. We use Rocchio algorithm
2. calculate the term frequency for each document
3. Divided by the length of the document
4. tf-idf
